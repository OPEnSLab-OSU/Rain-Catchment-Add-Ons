The browsers that work the best are Chrome and Firefox.


NOTE: This project has two files. One file contains a single Mariotte stopper and the other contains the three rate calibrator.
      When you download the project both files with automatically attached. When you edit the single Mariotte stopper file, the three 
      rate calibrator will update. The three instances of the Mariotte stoppers are the same, so changing one will change the others, too.
